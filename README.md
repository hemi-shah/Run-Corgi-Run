## Project Description
This project demonstrates my knowledge of game design and development using Unity in C#. 
The game, "Run Corgi Run," involves a player being able to use A, S, D, W keys to move a pixel character. 
The character can gain powerups and defects based on which 2D element the character collides with. 
The objective is to gain powerups and avoid defects, all while collecting as many "bone" 2D elements to increase the player score.
   
## Game Features 
- Key Input: Allows the player to move the character using A, S, D, W keys for movement.
- Power Ups: Grants the player special abilities upon collision.
- Defects: Impairs the players abilities upon collision.
- Timer: Gives the player a time constraint to gain as many points in that allotted time.
- Score: Allows the player to gain points to score each time they collide with a "bone" 2D element.
